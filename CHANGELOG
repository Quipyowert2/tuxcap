1.3_06:
        
        * Added particle engine which supports both physics enabled and normal particle systems. It is based on HGE's particle engine and support HGE's .psi particle system information files. Currently there's no particle editor distributed with TuxCap but HGE's particle editor runs beautifully with wine on GNU/Linux, so this can be freely downloaded additionally from HGE's site (http://hge.relishgames.com). A particle editor build entirely of TuxCap's widgets is being considered for future releases.
        
        * Added particle demo to show how to use the new particle system. This demo runs in  software mode by default. Change the value of the Is3D attribute to 1 in the particle demo's .ini file or uncomment the gSexyAppBase->SwitchScreenMode(true, true) line in GameApp.cpp of the particledemo project to enable 3D acceleration.
        
        * Improved cmake files and TuxCap header files to allow system wide installation of TuxCap.
        
        * Added software drawing of stretched images in both normal and additive drawing mode.
