1.3.08:
        * Automatic detection of 3D acceleration capability. Falling back to software rendering in case of no hardware acceleration.
        * Game binary and resources can now be separated from each other and installed in different locations. This is for instance needed for packaging. Use SetAppResourceFolder and GetAppResourceFolder for this.
        * Improved SetAppDataFolder and GetAppDataFolder, this now points to {HOME}/.mRegKey
        * No longer needed to cd to directory containing game binary. Game binary can be launched from any location. This makes it possible to launch a game directly from the menu without needing an intermediate script.
	* Now building 32 bit only even on 64 bit host
        * Fixes, changes and improvements to Pycap bindings, Chipmunk bindings, image loading and cmake files.

1.3.07:

        * Pycap python bindings library is now linked into the generated libtuxcap library too.
        * Added SDLMain.m and SDLMain.h for building on Mac OS X.
        * All demo's should build cleanly on Mac OS X and run in software mode.
        * Many changes to the cmake files for cleaner debianization of libtuxcap. 
        * Added software drawing for Additive Rect Fill.
        * Added particle and particle system scaling to the particle engine. Added this to the demo too.
        * Renamed and moved some of the python Pycap demo's.
                
1.3_06:
        
        * Added particle engine which supports both physics enabled and normal particle systems. It is based on HGE's particle engine and support HGE's .psi particle system information files. Currently there's no particle editor distributed with TuxCap but HGE's particle editor runs beautifully with wine on GNU/Linux, so this can be freely downloaded additionally from HGE's site (http://hge.relishgames.com). A particle editor build entirely of TuxCap's widgets is being considered for future releases.        
        * Added particle demo to show how to use the new particle system. This demo runs in  software mode by default. Change the value of the Is3D attribute to 1 in the particle demo's .ini file or uncomment the gSexyAppBase->SwitchScreenMode(true, true) line in GameApp.cpp of the particledemo project to enable 3D acceleration.
        * Improved cmake files and TuxCap header files to allow system wide installation of TuxCap.
        * Added software drawing of stretched images in both normal and additive drawing mode.
