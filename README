This is the GNU/Linux and Mac OSX port of PopCap's Games Framework
It was ported by W.P. van Paassen in June 2007

========================
"Lieve Sabine, 
      
                3 keer kracht 
                         *
                3 keer hoop
                         =
                9 keer leven

                           Heel veel sterkte,
                                We zijn er voor je

                                          Je mannen"
========================

--HOW TO BUILD--

The library depends on CMake, SDL, SDL_mixer and Magick++

To build the library and the examples:

cd tuxcap-build
cmake ..
make

--INSTALL--

to install the shared library in /usr/local/lib

make install

-----------------

You can change the install directory by calling cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/installdir ..

!Notice that all examples run in software mode by default!

change the value of the Is3D attribute to 1 in the demo's .ini file or add the gSexyAppBase->SwitchScreenMode(true, true) line to the Init function of  GameApp.cpp to enable 3D acceleration. Some demo's like demo_5 and Hungarr come with an in-game dialog to enable/disable 3D acceleration.

The particle system is based on HGE's particle system and excepts .psi files 
created with HGE's editor which is part of the HGE distribution.
It also accepts .psi files created with James Poag's extended particle editor.

I use wine to run the latest HGE (1.8) particle editor, it runs beautifully! 


Hack on!

Cheers,
W.P.
